A short alphabetic code, preferring 3-characters for country (e.g. USA), 2-characters for region (e.g. CA), and either 3-character or 2-character for county (e.g. HUM or HU) placetypes. Other placetypes like venue can also have shortcodes but their length is not standardized, and they may contain alphanumeric values.",
